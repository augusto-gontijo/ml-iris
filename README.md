# What is this Project?

This is my approach on the "Iris Species" classification/clustering dataset.

The objective here is to accurately classify/cluster a plant into 3 possible species, based on its petal and sepal measurements (more on that on the next section).

# About the Dataset

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems (http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf), and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

SepalLengthCm </br>
SepalWidthCm </br>
PetalLengthCm </br>
PetalWidthCm </br>
Species

# What is a petal and a sepal?

Morphologically, both sepals and petals are modified leaves. The calyx (the sepals) and the corolla (the petals) are the outer sterile whorls of the flower, which together form what is known as the perianth
